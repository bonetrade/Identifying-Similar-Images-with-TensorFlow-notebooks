It's based on Douglas Duhaime's tutorial [identifying similar images with tensorflow](http://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html) which is very clearly laid out and explained. In this notebook, I've compressed the steps. The 'images' directory only has 25 images in it for demo purposes. In Duhaime's post, the images folder (that you grab with `wget` has about 2000 images in it).
